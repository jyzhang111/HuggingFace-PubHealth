## Important note

The notebook was developed in Colab. To make sure you can successfully run the notebook outside of Google Colab, **do not run the first code block**. Instead, install these requirements locally. You can do this by executing the following steps on the command line:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyzhang111/HuggingFace-PubHealth
pip install datasets --quiet
pip install transformers --quiet
```
